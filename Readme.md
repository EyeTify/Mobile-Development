# EyeTify : Mobile Development

## üìë Description
This Application focused on the early detection of eye diseases. Leveraging advanced technologies like cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) and image classification, the team has created an interactive and effective diagnostic tool for users. By analyzing eye images taken with a smartphone camera, Eyetify can quickly and accurately identify conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and more. Our team aims to facilitate early diagnosis to help users maintain healthy eyes.
