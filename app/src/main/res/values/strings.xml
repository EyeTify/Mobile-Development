    <string-array name="data_description">
        <item>Cataract is like having a built-in blurry filter over your eyes, where the clear lens of the eye becomes clouded, making vision unclear. This is usually a problem for older adults but can sometimes affect younger individuals as well. Therefore, it\'s important to take them to an eye doctor for examination.</item>
        <item>Glaucoma is like a stealth ninja attacking the eyes, but instead, it raises the pressure inside the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and eventually lead to blindness. It can occur without symptoms, so regular eye checks are important.</item>
        <item>Conjunctivitis is like an unwelcome guest that makes your eyes appear red, itchy, and feel like there\'s something gritty in them. This can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, allergies, or irritation from certain substances.</item>
        <item>Uveitis is like a disruption in the eye\'s middle party called the uvea, which consists of the iris, choroid, and ciliary body. It can be caused by infection, autoimmune reactions, or trauma, and can result in painful inflammation and eye damage if untreated.</item>
        <item>Hordeolum, often called a stye, is an inflammation of the oil glands in the eyelid. It\'s typically caused by bacterial infection, especially Staphylococcus aureus. This condition causes the formation of a red, painful lump and swelling on the eyelid.</item>
        <item>Bulging eyes, or known as exophthalmos, is a condition where the eyeball protrudes abnormally from the eye socket. This can be caused by various factors, including Graves\' disease, tumors around the eye, or swelling of tissue behind the eye. This condition can disrupt eye function and aesthetics.</item>

    <string-array name="data_indication">
        <item>When you start feeling like you\'re looking through a cloudy lens or seeing small clouds floating in front of your eyes, it could be cataracts. Increased sensitivity to bright light and dull colors can also be signs of cataracts.</item>
        <item>Now, the tricky part about glaucoma is that it can come without you noticing. But if there are symptoms, you may feel pain in the eyes, blurry vision, red eyes, and sometimes see rainbow-colored halos around bright lights.</item>
        <item>If you have conjunctivitis, your eyes usually feel itchy, watery, and red. Sometimes it feels like there\'s sand in your eyes, and peeling of the eyelids may occur. The symptoms can affect both eyes simultaneously.</item>
        <item>Symptoms can vary depending on the affected part of the eye and its severity, but typically include red eyes, eye pain, sensitivity to light, blurry vision, and possibly "blind spots" in the field of vision.</item>
        <item>Usually, a hordeolum appears as a red lump that feels painful on the eyelid, either on the outer (external hordeolum) or inside the eyelid (internal hordeolum). The lump may feel warm to touch and sometimes contain pus. Patients may also feel burning or itching around the affected area.</item>
        <item>Main symptoms of bulging eyes include clearly visible eye protrusion, changes in facial appearance, difficulty in fully closing the eyes (lagophthalmos), and possibly changes in vision or a sensation of pressure on the eyes. Patients may also experience excessive sweating or irritation in the bulging eyes.</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="data_cause">
        <item>Cataracts are actually a natural aging process, where the eye\'s lens begins to accumulate proteins, causing it to become cloudy. However, there are several risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing cataracts, such as family history, diabetes, or smoking habits. Therefore, it\'s important to avoid cigarette smoke and maintain eye health.</item>
        <item>Glaucoma is usually caused by high pressure within the eye, which can be due to blocked fluid flow or other issues. Risk factors include old age, family history, and medical conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure.</item>
        <item>Conjunctivitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria, allergies, or irritants. Risk factors include direct contact with infected individuals, exposure to allergens such as pollen or animal fur, and improper hygiene in using contact lenses.</item>
        <item>Uveitis can be caused by various factors, ranging from viral or bacterial infections to autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn\'s disease. Risk factors include a history of autoimmune disease or infection, as well as genetic factors.</item>
        <item>Hordeolum is caused by bacterial infection entering the oil glands around the eye. Risk factors for developing hordeolum include poor hygiene, direct contact with bacteria, excessive use of cosmetics, or medical conditions that weaken the immune system.</item>
        <item>Bulging eyes can be caused by several conditions, including Graves\' disease, which is a common cause of exophthalmos. Other risk factors include a family history of similar conditions, thyroid disease, or exposure to radiation. The use of certain medications or smoking habits can also increase the risk.</item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="data_service">
        <item>To treat cataracts, an eye doctor usually recommends surgery to replace the cloudy lens with a new one. However, to reduce the risk or slow its progression, you can use sunglasses to protect your eyes from UV rays, maintain a healthy diet, and regularly check your eyes with a doctor. Additionally, avoiding habits that can worsen eye health is crucial.</item>
        <item>Glaucoma cannot be completely cured, but it can be controlled with medications, eye drops, or even surgery. To prevent it, it\'s important to maintain eye pressure within normal limits with proper care and regular eye checks.</item>
        <item>To treat conjunctivitis, it depends on the cause. The doctor may prescribe antibiotic eye drops for bacterial infections, or antihistamine medications for allergies. To prevent spread, it\'s important not to rub your eyes, maintain hand hygiene, and avoid sharing towels or personal items with others if you are infected.</item>
        <item>Treatment for uveitis depends on its cause, but often involves using anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroid eye drops or oral medications. It\'s important to get prompt treatment to prevent permanent eye damage. Prevention of uveitis usually involves managing underlying health conditions, such as controlling autoimmune diseases or avoiding infections if possible.</item>
        <item>Treatment for hordeolum often involves applying warm compresses regularly to help open clogged glands and reduce swelling. Doctors may also prescribe topical antibiotics such as eye drops or ointments to help treat the infection. Prevention of hordeolum involves maintaining eye and eyelid hygiene, avoiding contact with potentially bacteria, and avoiding excessive use of cosmetics around the eyes.</item>
        <item>Treatment for bulging eyes depends on its cause. For conditions like Graves\' disease, treatment may involve hormone therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs, or even surgery to reduce eye pressure. Prevention of bulging eyes often relates to managing underlying medical conditions, such as controlling thyroid disease or avoiding specific risk factors such as smoking or excessive radiation exposure.</item>
